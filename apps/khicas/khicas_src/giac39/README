Changes for KhiCAS in ExistOS https://github.com/ExistOS-Team
  
The files of this archive should be copied to
      https://github.com/ExistOS-Team/giac_xcas-for-39gii
  
The file changes.tgz should be unarchived at the top level of the
ExistOS directory
      https://github.com/ExistOS-Team/ExistOS-For-HP39GII
and OSLoader/VmMgr/vmMgr.c should be erased.
  1/ kcasporing_gl.h kcasporing_gl.c khicas_stub.cpp 
  includes changes for shell font (16 instead of 12) and 1 bit per pixel storage
  2/ SystemConfig.h to OSLoader/Config
  changes: rom size 6Mo, ram size 3M (loader script also set 6M of ROM)
  this in order to be able to run the full KhiCAS with all CAS commands, spreadsheet, geometry, finance.
  3/ SysConf.h to System/Config: ram size 3M
  4/ start.c : added F3 check at startup, so that one can flash System
  without expecting that System is running in RAM
  changed printing order for USB MSC mode (otherwise USB does
  not work, no idea why)
  5/ various memory load optimizations (reordering object files) to avoid
  some gaps in memory. Total fee memory available 288K = 32K non swappable
  and 256K swappable.
  6/ mixed RAM config: 32K at 0x20000000 never swapped (in giac used for
  1 bit per pixel display, and for fast allocations of 16 bits gen, 32 bits
  gen and 48 bits gen).

There is a potential improvement

but currently I'm unable to boot the calculator with this configuration.
